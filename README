FileSplitterJoiner comes as two parts:
    1. A program called filesplitter which splits the file into multiple parts.
       Run the program, type in the full file name and choose the method of
       splitting. Then press Split. If the original file is called boat.mkv,
       then the parts are called boat.mkv.1, boat.mkv.2, etc.
    2. A program called filejoiner which joins the multiple parts into a single
       file. Run the program, type in the full file name of the last part. Then
       press Join. The filename will be the name of the original file.
